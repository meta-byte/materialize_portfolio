                Hi! I'm Garrett. I'm a software development student at Western Governors University and I'm studying
                full-stack web development part time at the University of Utah. I've worked in the field of IT and
                support for the past 5 years and I love figuring out how things work.</p>
            <br>


            <p class="flow-text">Some of my hobbies include camping, hiking, hunting, building model kits, and playing
                video games with
                my friends. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer screen and I think it's really important to
                balance that with some real escapism. I was born and raised in Utah and the mountains of the Wasatch
                Front are in my opinion the best place to go for some high adventure.</p>
